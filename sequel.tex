\chapter{Sequel}
\label{sequel}
In May 2009, the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) released the trailer for a follow-up to the original 1992 video, which premiered on September 9, 2009. Don't Copy That 2 features M. E. Hart reprising his role as ''MC Double Def DP''. The trailer shows armed SWAT police raiding homes and arresting the mothers of would-be pirates. The SIIA website says that ''Antipiracy hero MC Double Def DP will return to drop some knowledge on would-be pirates in the sequel to 1992's 'Don't Copy That Floppy.'.''

\section{Criticism}
Don't Copy That 2 has received over 517,000 views on YouTube as of September 14, 2015. Since its release it has been criticized by the press for being out of date, referencing material like the Doom series and Klingon that the current target audience (mostly teenagers) may not be familiar with. The sequel was also heavily criticized in the press for misrepresenting the way copyright law is enforced, what types of copying were actually considered ''criminal'' enough to prompt punishment, and what punishment actually looked like.
